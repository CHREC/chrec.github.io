    title: "STP-H12-VANTAGE"
    body: "Visual And Neuromorphic Tracking And Geosensing Experiment (VANTAGE) is a next-generation 
          payload proposed for flight to the International Space Station on the Space Test Program - Houston 12 (STP-H12) pallet.
          VANTAGE is currently in-development and will be designed, built, and operated by the students and faculty of the 
          NSF Center for Space, High-performance, and Resilient Computing (SHREC) at the University of Pittsburgh. Learn more about this exciting research payload below!"
