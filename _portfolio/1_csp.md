Designed by SHREC students, CSP is one of the first computers containing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and radiation-hardened components to provide a radiation-tolerant yet powerful computing for space. CSP employs a Xilinx Zynq-7020 system-on-chip containing an Artix-7 FPGA fabric and a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor.
