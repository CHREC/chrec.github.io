This commercial system-on-module (SoM), designed by Conclusive Engineering, is the processing element of a novel approach to hybrid (commercial + radiation-hardened) computing. The SoM is mounted to a custom SHREC-developed carrier card, containing radiation-hardened supporting circuitry such as watchdog timers and non-volatile memory. This commercial SoM and radiation-tolerant carrier combination is one of the first systems to push the boundaries of performant and reliable commercial computing in space. This system leverages a Microchip PolarFire SoC, which contains four 64-bit RISC-V processing cores, as well as a PolarFire FPGA fabric.
