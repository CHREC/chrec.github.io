Designed by SHREC students, the SHREC Space Processor (SSP) is a higher-performance alternative to the CHREC Space Processor (CSP). SSP is one of the first computers containing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and radiation-hardened components to provide a radiation-tolerant yet powerful computing system for space. SSP leverages a Xilinx Zynq-7045 system-on-chip containing a Kintex-7 FPGA fabric and a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor. Higher-performance features of the SSP include support for multi-gigabit transceivers and dedicated programmable logic DDR memory.
