Designed as a successor to the CSP, the SHREC Space Processor (SSP) provides the same hybrid-computing concept with more FPGA acceleration power. SSP employs a Zynq-7045 system-on-chip with a Kintex-7 FPGA fabric and a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor, supporting the addition of multi-gigabit transcevers and dedicated programmable-logic DDR memory.
