This commercial GPU system-on-module (SoM), developed by NVIDIA, enables VANTAGE to accelerate computations that can benefit from massively-paralell architectures. The architectural approach for this module is very similar to the

This commercial GPU system-on-module (SoM), designed by NVIDIA, is another processing element that uses SHREC's novel hybrid (commercial + radiation-hardened) computing approach. This SoM is paired with a custom SHREC-developed carrier card, leveraging the same novel approach used with the PolarFire SoC SoM. The custom carrier contains radiation-hardened supporting circuitry, such as watchdog timers and non-volatile memory, to maximize system performance and dependability at minimal cost. This system contains 1,024 NVIDIA Ampere cores and 32 Tensor cores.
