Designed and built by Prophesee, based in Paris, France, the neuromorphic sensor is an asynchronous event-based vision sensor modelled after the human eye. The sensor's biomimetic model ignores any redundant, static background information in its field of view, passing only moving events measured by luminosity changes. This method of capture provides a very high dynamic range (>120 dB) and a low temporal resolution (on the order of microseconds).
