Designed and built by Sony, the XCL-SG1240C is an industrial RGB camera system with a 12.4 global shutter CMOS sensor. VANTAGE is the first SHREC mission to have RGB data available directly from the sensor, without the need for post-processing. The VANTAGE visual sensor is paired with high-magnification catadioptric lenses to enable low ground-resolved-distance (GRD) capture.
