Designed and built by Kenko Tokina in Tokyo, Japan, the SZ line of lenses used on VANTAGE are catadioptric systems: both refraction and reflection occur within the assemblies. Lenses designed with this approach are extremely compact and lightweight, while also providing telephoto focal lengths similar to larger and heavier conventional lenses. Both the Sony camera and the Prophesee neuromorphic sensor are attached to their own dedicated lens assemblies, enabling low-GRD data capture.
